## FoodController.cs

The FoodController class is part of the FoodApp namespace and is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to food items in the catalog. It interacts with the database context FoodDBContext to perform CRUD operations on CatalogItem entities. Here are the key functionalities provided by the FoodController:

- GetFood: Retrieves all food items from the database.
- GetById: Fetches a single food item by its ID.
- CreateFood: Adds a new food item to the database.
- UpdateFood: Updates an existing food item in the database.
- DeleteFood: Deletes a food item from the database by its ID.

This controller uses dependency injection to receive an instance of FoodDBContext for database operations and an instance of AILogger for logging purposes. The routes are defined using attributes, making it easy to map HTTP requests to the corresponding action methods.
